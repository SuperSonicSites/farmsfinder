Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm has been family-owned and operated for more than 25 years, continuing a cherished tradition of offering a natural and memorable Christmas tree experience. Now in its ninth season under the current generation, the farm was built on the idea of recreating the timeless tradition of families strolling through forests in search of the perfect Christmas tree.

In 2023, Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm made the difficult decision to suspend its cut-your-own service. This change allows the farm to rehabilitate, while also addressing liability concerns and the increase in vandalism experienced during the 2022 season.

Dedicated to sustainability, Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm emphasizes the many benefits of real Christmas trees. Unlike artificial options, natural trees are renewable, biodegradable, and environmentally friendly—providing oxygen, shelter for wildlife, and the unmistakable fragrance of a true holiday tree.

Visitors are also invited to explore the Farm's Gift Shop, which offers an excellent selection of locally made, high-quality crafts perfect for gifting or decorating during the season.

Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm extends warm holiday wishes and looks forward to remaining a beloved part of local Christmas traditions for years to come.
