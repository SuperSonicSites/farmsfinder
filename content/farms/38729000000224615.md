Crawford Trees has been family owned and operated since 1988, growing premium-grade Christmas trees with care and dedication. Located at 300 Royalton Road, the Crawford family—Andrew, Colleen, and Jordan—have been replanting and cultivating trees from their very own seed orchard for more than three decades.

The farm specializes in Balsam Fir, Fraser Fir, and Cook Blue Fir, along with other carefully selected varieties. Each tree is nurtured to meet the highest standards, ensuring families can bring home a tree that is fresh, full, and beautifully shaped for the holiday season.

In addition to trees, Crawford Trees also handcrafts wreaths, offering a festive touch to complement your holiday décor. Open daily during daylight hours throughout the Christmas season, the farm provides a welcoming atmosphere where tradition and quality come together year after year.
