Briggs Tree Farm is a family-owned and operated farm that has been growing and selling Christmas trees to the Ottawa community for over 40 years. Nestled within a beautiful 100-acre woodland, the farm offers a traditional and memorable holiday experience where visitors can stroll through the forest to find their perfect tree.
The farm features a variety of trees ideal for Christmas, including Scotch Pine, Balsam Fir, White Spruce, and Norway Spruce. Each tree is carefully trimmed to maintain a natural shape, with a range of sizes and fullness to suit every home and holiday style.
Visitors are invited to enjoy a walk through the scenic woods, cut their own spruce, balsam, or scotch pine tree, and select a handcrafted natural Christmas wreathâ€”making Briggs Tree Farm a festive destination for families year after year.
