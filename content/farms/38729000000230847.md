Catfish Creek Christmas Tree Farm has a rich history rooted in family tradition. The land was first purchased in 1974 by Gordon’s parents, where Gordon spent his childhood helping with farm life—selling eggs, raising chickens, and caring for horses.

In 2002, Gordon purchased the farm from his parents and began shaping it with his own vision. By 2009, alongside his wife Corinne, the couple planted and began maintaining 500 Christmas tree seedlings, laying the foundation for what would become a cherished holiday destination.

Today, Catfish Creek Christmas Tree Farm is proudly operated by Gordon, Corinne, and their son, combining the legacy of a traditional family farm with the magic of a Christmas tree farm. Each season, they provide their community with festive experiences, lasting memories, and the joy of finding the perfect Christmas tree.
