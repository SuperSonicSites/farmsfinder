Catfish Creek Christmas Tree Farm is a family-owned operation that has been in business since 1974. The farm was originally purchased by Gordon's parents, and he spent his childhood selling eggs, chicken, and caring for horses. In 2002, Gordon took over the farm and started making changes, and in 2009 he married Corinne. Together, they began planting and maintaining 500 Christmas tree seedlings, and now they work with their son to run both the traditional farm and the Christmas tree farm. Visitors can enjoy a 25-minute trail walk through the forest, past fields, and Christmas trees, and then select their own White Spruce, Balsam Fir, or Scotch Pine trees ranging from 5-9 feet tall. The farm provides saws and chainsaws, and also offers other products like maple syrup, cookies, hot apple cider, and honey. Pets are welcome but must be kept on a leash, and the farm is accessible for those with physical disabilities, though the ground can be slippery and muddy depending on weather conditions.
