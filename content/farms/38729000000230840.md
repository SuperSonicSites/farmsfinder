Blue Harvest Farm is more than a Christmas tree farm—it’s a place built to feel like home. Originally the family homestead, it is now run by the owner, her husband David, their children Blake and Samira, and their red retriever Elaina. Surrounded by beautiful views and breathtaking sunsets, the farm invites guests to experience the joy of choosing the perfect Christmas tree while creating lasting family memories.

Giving back has always been at the heart of Blue Harvest Farm. For many years, the family hosted an annual sale of one-of-a-kind garden trial plants to support local charities and their hospital. Today, that tradition of generosity continues with the Giving Tree Ornaments, where 100% of sales go directly toward helping local families enjoy a memorable Christmas.

During the holiday season, visitors can enjoy festive experiences including Santa’s visit, holiday crafts, gifts, seasonal décor, and Christmas photo opportunities—all designed to bring warmth, joy, and community spirit to every guest.
