Blue Harvest Farm is a family-owned Christmas tree farm located in Simcoe, Ontario. Established by Lara and David Norman, the farm has been growing memories for generations, offering a picturesque setting for families to select their perfect Christmas tree. Visitors can choose from a variety of fresh-cut tree types, including Balsam Fir, Canaan Fir, Fraser Fir, and Koreana Fir, ranging from 6 to 10 feet tall. In addition to the Christmas trees, the farm offers a wide range of holiday decor, including fresh wreaths, porch planters, and rustic birch ornaments and gifts. Guests can enjoy festive activities like Santa visits, crafts, and Christmas photos, as well as warm up by the cozy campfire with a cup of hot chocolate. The farm is also committed to giving back to the local community, with 100% of sales from their Giving Tree Ornaments going towards supporting families in need during the holiday season.
