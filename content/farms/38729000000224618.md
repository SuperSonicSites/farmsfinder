Domaine Clovis is a family farm in Sainte-Anne-de-Sorel that celebrates the gifts of nature through both Christmas trees and maple syrup production. For more than a generation, the farm has combined eco-responsible agriculture with time-honored traditions to offer products that are authentic, sustainable, and crafted with care.

In the spring, the farm’s sugarbush of majestic red maples yields a rich, flavorful maple syrup. This pure syrup, produced to federation standards, is transformed into a variety of maple products—all available at the on-site boutique. Each item reflects the farm’s commitment to quality and the unmistakable taste of traditional Quebec maple.

During the holiday season, visitors are invited to wander through the Christmas tree fields, choose and cut their own tree, or select from a range of pre-cut options. Tree stands and festive decorations are also available, making it easy to bring the spirit of the season home. With environmentally conscious practices like natural ground covers, organic fertilizers, and a thriving ecosystem of birds and wildlife, Domaine Clovis ensures that every product and experience is rooted in respect for the land.

Whether you come for the maple syrup or the Christmas trees, Domaine Clovis offers a warm welcome, a taste of tradition, and memories to share with family year after year.
