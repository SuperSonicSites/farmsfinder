Bachner Family Christmas Tree Farm is rooted in a proud family tradition that began over 40 years ago, when Michael Bachner Sr. planted the farm’s very first Christmas trees. Today, four generations later, the Bachner family continues to carry on that legacy, nurturing trees with the same dedication and care that started it all.

The farm is committed to sustainable growth and hands-on care. Each tree is hand-trimmed in early summer, and with the help of irrigation, fertilization, and careful maintenance, the Bachners ensure that every tree grows healthy, full, and ready for families to enjoy. In April 2025, the farm introduced a new planting of Balsam–Fraser Fir cross trees, which will take several years to mature and offer even more variety for future generations.

For more than 35 years, Bachner Family Christmas Tree Farm has been providing the community with White Spruce, Fraser Fir, and other high-quality trees, grown with pride and care. With each new season, the family continues to strengthen its roots—both in the soil and in the community—ensuring that the tradition of bringing home a beautiful, fresh Christmas tree lives on for generations to come.
