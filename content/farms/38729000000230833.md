Bachner Family Christmas Tree Farm has been providing high-quality Christmas trees to families in the local area for over 35 years. The farm was established 40 years ago when Michael Bachner Senior planted the first crop of Christmas trees. Today, the farm offers a wide variety of trees, including White Spruce and Fraser Fir. The Bachner family takes great care in the planting and nurturing of their trees, hand-trimming each one in early summer and fertilizing and watering them regularly through an irrigation system. In 2016, the farm planted its first trees grown from the original seeds, and the fourth generation of the Bachner family is now involved in the Christmas tree operation, ensuring the family's traditions continue. Customers can choose and cut their own tree or select a pre-cut option, and the farm provides amenities like shaking, and saws. Pets are welcome on leashes, and the farm offers a cozy fire pit and bonfire area for visitors to enjoy.
