Blitzen Estate is a Christmas tree, maple syrup, and horse farm located in Jasper, Ontario, created by Caylyn and Kevin after leaving behind their fast-paced corporate careers. With backgrounds in health and safety management and corporate sales, the couple traded in global travel and high-stakes deals for small-town living and a farm that celebrates nature, tradition, and seasonal joy.

At Blitzen Estate, visitors will find more than just Christmas trees and maple syrup. Caylyn’s passion for horses brings unique experiences to the farm, with plans for sleigh rides, haunted hay rides, and other seasonal events that capture the festive spirit. Meanwhile, Kevin’s love for country living, combined with his people skills and storytelling, creates a warm and welcoming atmosphere for guests year-round.

With a focus on community, tradition, and creativity, Blitzen Estate is quickly becoming a local destination where families can gather, celebrate, and make memories in every season.
