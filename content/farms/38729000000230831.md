Al-Dor Farms is a family-run farm in Glen Valley, just 5 km east of historic Fort Langley. Albert and Dorothy Anderson bought the land in 1971, and by 1988, they had placed a small sign and an honour-system jar at the end of the road to sell pumpkins. What began as a simple roadside idea quickly grew into a beloved local tradition, complete with tractor-drawn hayrides and hands-on farm experiences.

Today, the Anderson family continues that legacy, welcoming visitors year-round with a focus on family-friendly fun, hands-on education, and friendly farm animals. The farm hosts a variety of seasonal events:

- Spring & Summer – school tours, birthday parties, private and corporate events
- Easter, Mother’s Day & Father’s Day – public openings with festive farm activities
- Fall – the Pumpkin Patch & Seasonal Market, offering fresh corn, U-pick sunflowers, pumpkins, sausages, artisan products, and farm animals
- December – a Christmas market and Christmas trees, complete with farm animals, hot chocolate, marshmallows by the campfire, and festive cheer.

From pumpkins to Christmas trees, from hayrides to holiday markets, Al-Dor Farms is dedicated to creating experiences where families can connect with nature, celebrate traditions, and make lasting memories.
