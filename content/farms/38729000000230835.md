Barrett’s Christmas Tree Farm opens for the season on November 29, 2025, welcoming families daily from 9am to 5pm through Christmas Eve. A family-owned farm rooted in tradition, Barrett’s offers both U-Cut and Pre-Cut Christmas trees, including premium Blue Spruce, with trees available in a variety of sizes. U-Cut trees up to 8ft are $62, with limited options above 8ft, while Pre-Cut trees range from $60–$110.

The farm is more than a place to find your perfect tree—it’s a holiday destination. Guests can enjoy the Family Fun Farm area (booking recommended), cozy up with hot chocolate or hot apple cider at the new Snack Shack, and indulge in treats like Grandma’s shortbread cookies, butter crunch chocolate, popcorn, and s’mores kits. On weekends, wagon rides run throughout the day, while horse-drawn wagon and sleigh rides add a magical touch for just $5 (weather permitting).

Families will also find plenty of festive activities: a play structure built by Bob for his kids in 1999, a bean bag toss game, and even a piece of aviation history—an authentic airplane displayed on the farm’s runway, restored to resemble a WWII Spitfire. Around the property, four campfire pits provide the perfect spot to warm up and roast marshmallows.

At Barrett’s Christmas Tree Farm, every detail—from hand-built benches to friendly staff—makes the experience more than just choosing a tree. It’s about creating family memories, celebrating the season, and enjoying a tradition that blends nature, history, and holiday fun.
