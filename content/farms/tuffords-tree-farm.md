Since 1965, Tufford's Tree Farm has been offering the perfect, non-commercial experience of picking out and cutting your own Christmas tree. In a quiet, rural setting with no lineups or crowds, a pleasant, short walk through the woods takes you to the large selection of trees to be cut fresh and brought home. The farm offers Scotch pine, White pine, White and Norway Spruce, and Balsam fir. Should there be a snowfall before your visit, you can enjoy a safe toboggan hill to slide down on, and afterwards warm up by a cozy bonfire.
