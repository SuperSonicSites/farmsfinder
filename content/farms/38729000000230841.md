Boat Harbour Farm is a 5-acre Christmas tree farm located in Cedar, BC, just south of Nanaimo. It offers a 'you pick, we cut, we shake, you load' experience, allowing customers to choose their tree while it's still standing in the field. The farm grows a variety of tree types including Douglas Fir, Grand Fir, Noble Fir, Nordmann Fir, Concolor Fir, Colorado Spruce, and Canaan Fir. Customers can park in the lower field and take their time selecting the perfect tree. After the tree is cut, it is shaken to remove loose needles, bird nests, and other debris. Pets are welcome but must be kept on a leash. The farm accepts cash, credit, and debit payments. It will be closed until the 2025 Christmas season.
