To enjoy the experience of cutting your own Christmas tree at Boisé Brabant, visitors are asked to book a date in advance at 721 Martel Rd. This system helps manage demand, reduce crowding, and ensure a safe, enjoyable visit for everyone, while also protecting the long-term sustainability of the tree plantation. Please note that the season is shorter this year, and trees will only be available while supplies last.

Boisé Brabant was founded in 2002 when Sylvie and Yvon embraced the chance to build something new as retirement approached. What began as a small Christmas tree venture has blossomed into both a family tradition and a local destination, where three generations now work together to welcome visitors each holiday season.

The farm offers an extensive selection of trees, from classics like Balsam Fir, Fraser Fir, White Spruce, and Blue Spruce to newly planted varieties including White Pine, Jack Pine, and Hemlock. For those seeking a more natural option, uncultivated spruce “wildlings” are also available at a reduced price. Sustainability is central to operations: no pesticides are used, and every tree harvested is replaced with new plantings by hand in the spring or fall.

In 2020, a sugar shack was added to the property, giving the family the ability to tap 325 red maples and produce small-batch maple syrup. This syrup is available throughout the year and during the Christmas tree season, adding a sweet tradition to the farm’s offerings.

At Boisé Brabant, guests will find more than just Christmas trees—they’ll discover a place where family values, nature, and holiday traditions come together to create lasting memories.
