Cedar Hill Christmas Tree Farm is a family-owned Christmas tree farm located in Pakenham, just outside of Ottawa, Ontario. The farm was originally settled in the 1820s and has a rich history, transitioning from a lumbering and sawmill operation to a dairy, beef, and sheep farm, and finally to a Christmas tree farm in 1988. Today, the farm is operated by the Martin family, who purchased it in 2016. Visitors can choose and cut their own Christmas trees from a variety of species including Fir, Spruce, and Pine, or select from a pre-cut selection. The farm offers a range of amenities and activities, including tree baling and shaking, wagon rides, hot chocolate and cider, a gift shop, and festive photo opportunities. Guests can also enjoy other seasonal attractions like a pumpkin patch, zip line, and kids' play area. With its picturesque setting, family-friendly atmosphere, and long-standing Christmas tradition, Cedar Hill Christmas Tree Farm is a beloved destination for Ottawa-area residents and visitors alike.
