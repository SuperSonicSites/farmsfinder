Hillcrest Tree Farm is situated on a 100-acre former dairy farm dating back to the 1800s. The farm consists of a white clapboard farmhouse, gambrel roof dairy barn, milk house, drive shed, henhouse, and pigsty. Visitors can choose from a selection of Scotch pine, white pine, white and Norway spruce, and balsam fir trees. The farm offers the option to cut your own tree or purchase a pre-cut tree. Guests can enjoy a pleasant walk through the woods to reach the tree fields. The property features a safe toboggan hill for winter fun, and a warm bonfire is available for visitors to gather around. Hillcrest Tree Farm has been preserving this family tradition since it was purchased in 1987, when the buildings were in poor condition and the fields were overgrown. The farm has since been restored and continues to offer a unique, non-commercial Christmas tree experience.
