      <description>&lt;p&gt;Al-Dor Farms is a family-run farm in Glen Valley, just 5 km east of historic Fort Langley. Albert and Dorothy Anderson bought the land in 1971, and by 1988, they had placed a small sign and an honour-system jar at the end of the road to sell pumpkins. What began as a simple roadside idea quickly grew into a beloved local tradition, complete with tractor-drawn hayrides and hands-on farm experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bachner Family Christmas Tree Farm is rooted in a proud family tradition that began over 40 years ago, when Michael Bachner Sr. planted the farm’s very first Christmas trees. Today, four generations later, the Bachner family continues to carry on that legacy, nurturing trees with the same dedication and care that started it all.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The farm is committed to sustainable growth and hands-on care. Each tree is hand-trimmed in early summer, and with the help of irrigation, fertilization, and careful maintenance, the Bachners ensure that every tree grows healthy, full, and ready for families to enjoy. In April 2025, the farm introduced a new planting of Balsam–Fraser Fir cross trees, which will take several years to mature and offer even more variety for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
