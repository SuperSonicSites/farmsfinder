      <description>&lt;p&gt;Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm has been family-owned and operated for more than 25 years, continuing a cherished tradition of offering a natural and memorable Christmas tree experience. Now in its ninth season under the current generation, the farm was built on the idea of recreating the timeless tradition of families strolling through forests in search of the perfect Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm made the difficult decision to suspend its cut-your-own service. This change allows the farm to rehabilitate, while also addressing liability concerns and the increase in vandalism experienced during the 2022 season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Catfish Creek Christmas Tree Farm has a rich history rooted in family tradition. The land was first purchased in 1974 by Gordon’s parents, where Gordon spent his childhood helping with farm life—selling eggs, raising chickens, and caring for horses.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2002, Gordon purchased the farm from his parents and began shaping it with his own vision. By 2009, alongside his wife Corinne, the couple planted and began maintaining 500 Christmas tree seedlings, laying the foundation for what would become a cherished holiday destination.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
