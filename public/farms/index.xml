      <description>&lt;p&gt;Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm has been family-owned and operated for more than 25 years, continuing a cherished tradition of offering a natural and memorable Christmas tree experience. Now in its ninth season under the current generation, the farm was built on the idea of recreating the timeless tradition of families strolling through forests in search of the perfect Christmas tree.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Carole’s Christmas Tree Farm made the difficult decision to suspend its cut-your-own service. This change allows the farm to rehabilitate, while also addressing liability concerns and the increase in vandalism experienced during the 2022 season.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Catfish Creek Christmas Tree Farm is a family-owned operation that has been in business since 1974. The farm was originally purchased by Gordon&amp;rsquo;s parents, and he spent his childhood selling eggs, chicken, and caring for horses. In 2002, Gordon took over the farm and started making changes, and in 2009 he married Corinne. Together, they began planting and maintaining 500 Christmas tree seedlings, and now they work with their son to run both the traditional farm and the Christmas tree farm.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
