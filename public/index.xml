Each tree is hand-trimmed in early summer, and with the help of irrigation, fertilization, and careful maintenance, the Bachners ensure that every tree grows healthy, full, and ready for families to enjoy. In April 2025, the farm introduced a new planting of Balsam–Fraser Fir cross trees, which will take several years to mature and offer even more variety for future generations.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
